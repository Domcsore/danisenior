    <h2>Mind the Music</h2>
    <p>I have been facilitating music as therapy sessions as part of a three-year program working with music and mental health, called Mind the Music, for more than 2 years now. These sessions have been taking place at every Monday since the program’s inception at the Coburn Centre in Newham. The Coburn centre is an in-patient service for young people with complex mental health difficulties, ranging from severe depression and trauma, to psychosis and schizophrenia.</p>
    <p>My main aim during these sessions has been to encourage the young people there to express themselves creatively through music and music making, and also to empower them by teaching them new skills. Research has shown that learning new skills can greatly help build self-esteem, and using music as therapy has been long proven to have a number of benefits; including helping people to process their emotions, trauma and grief, and regulate anxiety and stress. Needless to say, the work I have been doing here has been as rewarding as it has been eye opening.</p>
    <p>One of the key things I’ve learnt during my experience is that in order to truly serve the young person you are trying to help you need to be able to adapt your approach at a moment’s notice, and more importantly, adapt it according to the nature of that person’s unique condition. This comes with practice and experience no doubt, and I’ve learnt a number of effective approaches. These range from using mind-maps and the written form (instead of communicating verbally) as a way to write songs lyrically, to encouraging group collaboration through music production, to simply just sitting there and listening to music. One particular young person who I have been working with, and who does not communicate verbally that much, shows great contentment just listening to classical movie soundtracks with the headphones on. We use a headphone splitter so I can listen at the same time and he seems to find comfort in this share experience. He responds really positively when I show him some of my own favourite movie soundtracks and I believe this is because we are communicating in a non-threatening way, using music as the medium.</p>
    <p>Whichever technique I use, it has become clear that one of the most important things I can do for the young person with mental health issues is show them I am truly present by making meaningful eye-contact and actively listening. There is a great humanizing effect that these two simple behaviors seem to have and in return I see levels of trust increase, as was the case with one in-patient who at first was unable to make eye contact with me. Eventually she was able to smile, laugh and engage in ways that are considered more socialised, according to conventional standards. </p>
    <p>Another technique I use is to walk into my sessions in as calm a state as possible myself. The way I see it is that the in-patients here are experiencing enough turbulence given their current circumstances that the last thing they need is my external baggage being brought through the door. This I often do by taking a few minutes to meditate before sessions or by using the 4-7-8 breathing technique.</p>
    <p>As well as running mini lyric workshops, singing groups, and playing instruments, there is a solid technical element to the Mind the Music sessions. We bring Macbooks, microphones, sound cards and minirigs, and we are able to use this equipment to teach basic music production skills to those who are well enough. Learning new skills as I’ve mentioned earlier, is a great technique for confidence building and empowerment. We teach using the latest and top professional music software - Logic Pro X.</p>
    <p>I have been told that the Mind the Music sessions are extremely popular at the Coburn Centre. I’ve received a lot of heart-warming feedback from the young people themselves, which is always wonderful to hear, including sweeping statements such as, “Music gives my life meaning” and “Thank you for caring about us/giving us the opportunity to express ourselves”. We often arrive to a line of people queuing up in the corridor waiting for these sessions to begin, which is testament to the power of music in case we were in any doubt! </p>
